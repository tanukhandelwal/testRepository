It's time to get used to our new langauge, Objective-C. There are three test files in this project. All necessary tests are written, however they will all fail. There are also dummy/stub implementations of some methods for working with Objective-C objects in each test file.  Your task is to make those tests pass by implementing the methods.

## Adding files to your project

- Start a new Xcode project.
- Download the test files in this repo.
- Drag and drop the three test files in this repo to your new project. (drop in the file list in the left bar) Make sure to 'copy files' and check 'add to test target.'
